                                    DONT_HIGHLIGHT_ME


Description
-----------

dont_highlight_me is a weechat script allowing to prevent a user to highlight
you every single line.

Once loaded, it gives 3 commands :
  /no_hl_add <host>
  /no_hl_remove <host>
  /no_hl_list
They're meant to manage a list of hosts handled by the script to prevent being
highlighted from there users on irc.

How it works
------------

When someone loves to prefix his sentencs by your name as he talks to you and
you don't like it run:
  /no_hl_add <host_of_this_guy>

This will filter what he says and only display the first highlight (and nick
written). Highlights from this user will appear again if he stop for 30 seconds.
30 is a default value, edit PREVENT_DELAY to modify it.
